      <p class="p-bloon">Everything Urality does aims to support communities through conecting local business, community leaders, and creators with people physically in their community (whether local or vistor). The Customer Experience (defined as CX herewith) for Urality seeks to provide an answer to the question, “What’s going on in this community?”
        <br><br>
        The goal for this project was to create a CX in the form of a web application that connects users through location/proximity, with a heavy emphasis on discovery of “what’s nearby.” By doing this, users of Urality would be able explore through the CX the following four things:</p>
      <ol class="urality-list">
        <br>
        <li>1) Local events</li>

        <li>2) Local businesses</li>

        <li>3) Have a “Discovery” experience</li>

        <li>4) View nearby posts (Urality/Twitter/Instagram)</li>

  <!-- The Solution -->
    <section class="solution-section">
      <div class="solution-head">
        <h2 class="bloon-h2">Identifying a Solution</h2>
          <p>
            The design brings users in direct contact with what is happening near them through an experience of discovery. Four main tabs provide this insight:
          </p>
          <ol class="running-list">
            <li><span class="bold-p">The Nearby Tab</span> - Features local posts from Creators, Businesses, and other local entities (and also pulls in curated relevant content from Twitter and Instagram)</li><br>
            <li><span class="bold-p">The Events Tab</span> - Delivers upcoming filterable events based on user location/proximity</li><br>
            <li><span class="bold-p">The Business Tab</span> - Connects users directly with businesses by location/proximity, with filterable options</li><br>
            <li><span class="bold-p">The Discover Tab</span> - An interactive experience wherein the user narrows down results based on filtering down through categories (top level categories being Food, Drink, and Fun)</li>
          </ol>

    <!-- Research & Positioning-->
      <section class="User-Flows">
        <div class="UF-head">
          <h2 class="bloon-h2">Consulting the research and positioning the project</h2>
            <p>The guiding research for this project (and a central mantra of Urality) indicated that location-based content was our priority.
            <br><br>
            Users can find anything they are looking for using services under the Google umbrella, or products like Yelp. The missing link for users (and for communities) is the connection and open dialogue between what’s local, who is being discovered, and how users can find them. SEO and paid ad spots often block an organic connection between people in a community and local business. <span class="bold-p">Our CX would aim to better connect communities through proximity and discovery.</span>
            <br><br>
            After conducting some extensive user interviews, my teammate Matt Kelley provided these user personas that helped us target specific use cases:
            </p>
        </div>
        <figure class="UF-images">

        </figure>
        <div class="UF-head">
          <p>Matt also created some affinity maps of the data collected in his user interviews to help validate our emphasis on exploring local, discovering new businessess/events, and user behaviors.</p>
        </div>
        <figure class="UF-images">

        </figure>


        <div class="summary-head">
          <p class="p-bloon">
            The team then defined the four main sections that would comprise the CX. As outlined above, these sections were defined as:</p>
          <ol class="urality-list">
            <br>
            <li>1) Nearby</li>

            <li>2) Discover</li>

            <li>3) Business</li>

            <li>4) Events</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="summary-head">
          <p class="p-bloon">
            I was almost ready to being sketching ideas for how the CX would take shape. But first I needed to begin placing information in buckets in order to organize what would fall under each of these main four sections of the CX:</p>
        </div>

        <figure class="UF-images">
          <img class="UF-image" src="media/images/ur-map.jpeg" alt="Data Map">
          <figcaption class="figcaptionblack">I wrote this map of essential data points that would need to be accounted for under each of the four sections that comprise the CX.</figcaption>
        </figure>


        <div class="summary-head">
          <p class="p-bloon">
            In addition to this, I also needed to prepare for the categories and filters that would populate the Business and Events tab. I performed both open and closed card sorting exercises with test participants in order to validate groupings. This was particularly extensive for the business filters, but events was a more maneagble list.
            <br><br>
            <span class="bold-p">A note about conducting the card sorting exercises during the Covid-19 pandemic:</span> I chose to test neighbors who were comfortable doing socially-distanced tests. The card sort tests were set up in a ventilated room where I was able to give directions for the test from a distance. Users performed each exercise, and left the testing room before I photographed the results for analysis.
            <br><br>
            I was also able to conduct two tests virtually with participants who felt comfortable preparing the cards on their own from my directions.</p>

        <section class="Sketching-section">
          <div class="sketching-head">
            <h2 class="bloon-h3">Sketching</h2>
              <p>I began sketching in desktop view, since this would be the view with the most content on display at once. I conducted four rounds of sketching out each tab, with team feedback and discussion between each one. Each iteration we made adjustments. We saw the biggest changes with the Discover tab, which really transformed through three stages of sketching.</p>

  <!-- Nearby Sketches -->
          <div class="sketching-head2">
            <h2 class="bloon-h4">Nearby</h2>
              <p>The idea for the Nearby tab was that users would see posts native to Urality, or curated Instagram/Twitter posts that were “reposted” within the app by a Urality profile. The goal of this initial sketching was to produce lo-fi wireframes of layout and essential components.</p>

        <div class="sketching-head2">
          <h2 class="bloon-h4">Discover Tab</h2>
            <p>We began to ideate more on what the Discover tab was meant to accomplish, and if we were serving the user. By the third round, we sketched a fresh idea for the tab that would provide a filter-down experience of categories, which became the solution we went with. By breaking discovery into three cats (Food, Drink, and Fun), we could help organize generally what the user was looking for, and provide an interactive “discovery” experience.</p>

  <!-- Business Sketches -->
      <div class="sketching-head2">
        <h2 class="bloon-h4">Business Tab</h2>
          <p>The business tab originally featured an embedded map view (a feature already built out with functionality in another place within the Urality web app).
            <br><br>
            As we ideated through rounds, it was decided to abandon the map view and keep the business tab consistent with the Events tab layout. We also validated in our research that users were primarily focused on finding businesses based on category. By providing filtered results in order of proximity to the user, we were already serving that need for proximity (hence there was no need to display results on a map view). Next, we added a link/CTA within the pop-up view directly to Google Maps, in the case of users wanting to find a business on the map or seek directions.</p>

  <!-- Events Sketches -->
    <div class="sketching-head2">
      <h2 class="bloon-h4">Events</h2>
        <p>The layout for the Events tab stayed mainly untouched, aside from adjustments to the details on each card (to clear up user confusion in testing) and the filters used to narrow results. This layout is what we would carry over to the Business tab to maintain consistency.</p>

          <p class="p-bloon-dark">Throughout the project I kept a small group of core users from my research phase that I kept reaching out to with further questions and updates. One big realization that came to light at this point in the project was that users who run with an Apple Watch (or other wearable) would expect the ability to sync their runs into this app.
            <br><br>While the advance metrics and health monitoring stats that come from wearables might not be something we’d offer in a free version of this app, they would be important to consider when further designing out additional features for the premium subscribers (down the road).
            <br><br>
            <span class="p-bloon-dark-bold">At the very least, it would be critical for me to design this “sync” moment for users looking to connect their wearables to the app.</span></p>

          <p>As my hi-fi screens began to take form, I continued to resort back to the information I had gathered from user research. My task was to identify the visual solutions that focused around core features of the user experience: Miles run, average pace, total time, and map tracking.
            <br><br>
              It was also important to build an easy way for users to quickly modify essential settings to their run: miles vs. km, disabling auto-lock, and connecting a wearable GPS device.
            <br><br>
              Central to my project was the idea of users being able to use the app for one-off runs, without creating an account, and without saving data from their run. The onboarding screens I designed kept this idea front and center.</p>

        <h2 class="bloon-h2">Conclusion and What I Learned</h2>
          <p>This was a quick project that I had limited resources with. If I had more time and a budget, I would want to conduct some rounds of user testing with a prototype of my high-fidelity screens. It would be ideal to work with a developer to build a basic version of this app in order to allow testing on a run.
            <br><br>
            I really struggled with balancing how to keep a running app profitable, and designing an app that doesn’t require sign-ups from every user. I do think it would be possible to allow users to use the app without creating an account, but I would want to test this theory on real users.
