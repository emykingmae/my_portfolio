      <p class="p-bloon">Everything Urality does aims to support communities through conecting local business, community leaders, and creators with people physically in their community (whether local or vistor). The Customer Experience (defined as CX herewith) for Urality seeks to provide an answer to the question, “What’s going on in this community?”
        <br><br>
        The goal for this project was to create a CX in the form of a web application that connects users through location/proximity, with a heavy emphasis on discovery of “what’s nearby.” By doing this, users of Urality would be able explore through the CX the following four things:</p>
      <ol class="urality-list">
        <br>
        <li>1) Local events</li>

        <li>2) Local businesses</li>

        <li>3) Have a “Discovery” experience</li>

        <li>4) View nearby posts (Urality/Twitter/Instagram)</li>

  <!-- The Solution -->
    <section class="solution-section">
      <div class="solution-head">
        <h2 class="bloon-h2">Identifying a Solution</h2>
          <p>
            The design brings users in direct contact with what is happening near them through an experience of discovery. Four main tabs provide this insight:
          </p>
          <ol class="running-list">
            <li><span class="bold-p">The Nearby Tab</span> - Features local posts from Creators, Businesses, and other local entities (and also pulls in curated relevant content from Twitter and Instagram)</li><br>
            <li><span class="bold-p">The Events Tab</span> - Delivers upcoming filterable events based on user location/proximity</li><br>
            <li><span class="bold-p">The Business Tab</span> - Connects users directly with businesses by location/proximity, with filterable options</li><br>
            <li><span class="bold-p">The Discover Tab</span> - An interactive experience wherein the user narrows down results based on filtering down through categories (top level categories being Food, Drink, and Fun)</li>
          </ol>

    <!-- Research & Positioning-->
      <section class="User-Flows">
        <div class="UF-head">
          <h2 class="bloon-h2">Consulting the research and positioning the project</h2>
            <p>The guiding research for this project (and a central mantra of Urality) indicated that location-based content was our priority.
            <br><br>
            Users can find anything they are looking for using services under the Google umbrella, or products like Yelp. The missing link for users (and for communities) is the connection and open dialogue between what’s local, who is being discovered, and how users can find them. SEO and paid ad spots often block an organic connection between people in a community and local business. <span class="bold-p">Our CX would aim to better connect communities through proximity and discovery.</span>
            <br><br>
            After conducting some extensive user interviews, my teammate Matt Kelley provided these user personas that helped us target specific use cases:
            </p>
        </div>
        <figure class="UF-images">

        </figure>
        <div class="UF-head">
          <p>Matt also created some affinity maps of the data collected in his user interviews to help validate our emphasis on exploring local, discovering new businessess/events, and user behaviors.</p>
        </div>
        <figure class="UF-images">

        </figure>


        <div class="summary-head">
          <p class="p-bloon">
            The team then defined the four main sections that would comprise the CX. This is when we arrived at these four tabs as part of the solution:</p>
          <ol class="urality-list">
            <br>
            <li>1) Nearby</li>

            <li>2) Discover</li>

            <li>3) Business</li>

            <li>4) Events</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="summary-head">
          <p class="p-bloon">
            I was almost ready to being sketching ideas for how the CX would take shape. But first I needed to begin placing information in buckets in order to organize what would fall under each of these main four sections of the CX:</p>
        </div>

        <figure class="UF-images">
          <img class="UF-image" src="media/images/ur-map.jpeg" alt="Data Map">
          <figcaption class="figcaptionblack">I wrote this map of essential data points that would need to be accounted for under each of the four main sections of the CX:</figcaption>
        </figure>


        <div class="summary-head">
          <p class="p-bloon">
            In addition to this, I also needed to prepare for the categories and filters that would populate the Business and Events tab. I performed both open and closed card sorting exercises with test participants in order to validate groupings. This was particularly extensive for the business filters, but events was a more maneagble list.
            <br><br>
            <span class="bold-p">A note about conducting the card sorting exercises during the Covid-19 pandemic:</span> I chose to test neighbors who were comfortable doing socially-distanced tests. The card sort tests were set up in a ventilated room where I was able to give directions for the test from a distance. Users performed each exercise, and left the testing room before I photographed the results for analysis.
            <br><br>
            I was also able to conduct two tests virtually with participants who felt comfortable preparing the cards on their own from my directions.</p>

        <section class="Sketching-section">
          <div class="sketching-head">
            <h2 class="bloon-h3">Sketching</h2>
              <p>I began sketching in desktop view, since this would be the view with the most content on display at once. I conducted four rounds of sketching out each tab, with team feedback and discussion between each one. Each iteration we made adjustments. We saw the biggest changes with the Discover tab, which really transformed through three stages of sketching.</p>

  <!-- Nearby Sketches -->

            <h2 class="bloon-h4">Nearby</h2>
              <p>The idea for the Nearby tab was that users would see posts native to Urality, or curated Instagram/Twitter posts that were “reposted” within the app by a Urality profile. The goal of this initial sketching was to produce lo-fi wireframes of layout and essential components.</p>

          <h2 class="bloon-h4">Discover Tab</h2>
            <p>We began to ideate more on what the Discover tab was meant to accomplish, and if we were serving the user. By the third round, we sketched a fresh idea for the tab that would provide a filter-down experience of categories, which became the solution we went with. By breaking discovery into three cats (Food, Drink, and Fun), we could help organize generally what the user was looking for, and provide an interactive “discovery” experience.</p>

      <div class="sketching-head2">
        <h2 class="bloon-h4">Business Tab</h2>
          <p>The business tab originally featured an embedded map view (a feature already built out with functionality in another place within the Urality web app).
            <br><br>
            As we ideated through rounds, it was decided to abandon the map view and keep the business tab consistent with the Events tab layout. We also validated in our research that users were primarily focused on finding businesses based on category. By providing filtered results in order of proximity to the user, we were already serving that need for proximity (hence there was no need to display results on a map view). Next, we added a link/CTA within the pop-up view directly to Google Maps, in the case of users wanting to find a business on the map or seek directions.</p>

          <br><br>
          At this stage of the design, these were the first wireframes I produced based on the sketches we had. While these were not compeltely hi-fi, I wanted to add enough visual context that user testing would be effective:

        <h2 class="bloon-h2">Conclusion and What I Learned</h2>
          <p>As always, it’s critical that designers request, and make space for, honest feedback from their development partners throughout the design process, and most importantly, listen to and consider that feedback. In a time when so much emphasis is placed on speed, shipping products fast, and building MVPs (all important), designers must take care to be sure the design process doesn’t move at a pace that hinders the outcome.
            <br><br>
            Additionally to this, as ever, we can mitigate potential implementation issues by collaborating one-on-one with developers early in the design process.
            <br><br>
            On this project, I was collaborating one-on-one with development from the first early sketches. What I learned is that as a designer I can save time and design more production-ready solutions if I can identify the pieces of my design that would create the most issues in development.
            <br><br>
            In addition, as ever, I learned to never tie yourself to a solution when the research is suggesting otherwise. Listen to the research and feedback, and do not hestitate to make changes. Don’t be precious about your first ideas.
            <br><br>
            On a final note: if approaching this project again, I would have considered wireframing the mobile experience simultaneous to the desktop. I made some assumptions about how the design would translate to the mobile view that turned out to be wrong, and then required some more time to ideate down the line.
