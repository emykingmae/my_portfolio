      <p class="bold-p">I’m Justin, a Product Designer currently based in Brooklyn.</p><p><br>Drawing on a background in project management, I’m a designer who understands how to identify the problem at hand, communicate in a way the entire team can align around, then build a user experience that not only solves user problems, but delights.<br><br>Here are some of my core design beliefs:</p>

  <div class="Design-beliefs">
    <span class="bold-p">
      I believe there is significant business value in implementing design systems across organizations, and that everyone has the ability to (and should) wear the designer hat sometimes.<br><br>

      I believe in collaboration, and in the power of a great team that listens to each other.<br><br>

      I believe in talking to our users (a lot).<br><br>

      I believe the best design solutions are built on the foundations of qualitative user research, project constraints, and lots of communication with and support from colleagues.<br><br>

      I believe in an iterative approach.<br><br>

      I believe technology can make our lives easier and more enjoyable, and I’m interested in how we do that in a way that’s inclusive and serves everyone.

      <h3>Life is never a straight line. This is why we should never be afraid to accept new dreams and goals for ourselves.</h3><br><br><br><br>
      <p>My creativity and desire to solve problems for people have always been a unique piece of who I am. I’m at my best when I’m in a state of creating and when I’m finding solutions to difficult problems.<br><br>At Penguin Random House I first grew as a <span class="bold-p">creative problem solver and as a team leader</span>. I experienced the joy in bringing a project from an idea to a final product and seeing the world interact with it. <span class="bold-p">As a project manager I learned how to navigate many personalities, approach their problems with empathy, and then work with them to find answers.</span> But when I looked around at the projects I was involved in I began asking, “What piece of this equation most interests me?” It was the designers whose work I most wanted to jump into.<br><br>I quickly discovered the world of design was so vast, filled with so many kinds of problem solvers and creative people doing remarkable work across industries. I wanted in.<br><br>This is when I started developing my passion for the discipline of UX Design.<br><br><span class="bold-p">I enrolled in Bloc/Thinkful’s UX Design and Frontend immersive bootcamp</span> and it was there that I found the structure I was missing to level up my design and computer science education. I evolved as a professional and captured a new dream of helping to build the user experiences of the future.<br><br>I believe that no matter what we do with our days, <span class="bold-p">staying curious is the key to unlocking so much of our own potential and doing great work.</span> I hope you and I get the chance to work together. Everyone has their own story to tell and I’m interested in learning about yours and what your ideas are for building great tech.</p>
