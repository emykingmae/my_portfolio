    <div class="problem-inner">
      <h2 class="bloon-dark-h2">The Problem</h2>
        <p class="p-bloon-dark">By conducting an extensive user survey, I learned that cloud users’ top two frustrations are the amount of accounts they have, and how hard it is to locate the content they’re looking for.<br><br>What the research revealed is that many users are employing the same cloud account at home to organize personal content as they are at work. (This is amplified if a user’s employer is already footing the bill for a premium amount of storage.)<br><br>In addition, most cloud services are packed with well-meaning features and buttons that actually clutter the experience of organizing content.<br><br>This presents a problem: personal content and work content are mixing into one disorganized mess somewhere high in the clouds.</p>

<!-- User Research -->
  <section class="UR-section">
    <div class="UR-head">
      <h2 class="bloon-h2">User Research</h2>
        <p>Digging for an under-served market of users in the cloud space started with canvasing a large set of users. My survey reached people in 17 cities across the U.S., 85% of whom were between the ages of 22 and 40.<br><br>95% of these users said they currently use a cloud storage service at least once a day, and almost all of them said they would switch services if a better option became available.<br><br>Within this group was this demographic of busy professionals who crave seamless   tools that give them more efficiency. These users see the cloud as an alternative to word processing softwares, and as an archive for their photos through the years (and through phone upgrades). Their problems rooted deeply in how they organize their digital lives (and manage content overload).<br><br><span class="bold-p">What began to emerge from this initial research was a set of users with values of minimalism over complexity, a clean space over a cluttered one, and a desire to foster a separation of work and home.</span>

      <p> As part of the project’s discovery phase, I created some personas to narrow in on my niche set of core users and fully understand their unique problem set. By synthesizing data collected in my user survey I was able to bring some potential use cases to life and empathize fully with who I was designing for and their diversity of needs.

<!-- Competitive Analysis -->

      <h2 class="bloon-h2">Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <div class="ca-image">
          <img class="ca-image" src="media/images/CA-image.png" alt="Logos from Competitive Analysis">
        </div>
      <p>By doing a competitive analysis of the major players in the field I learned what users have come to expect from these tools in their daily lives and where these big name services are currently falling short for my target user base.
      <br><br>DropBox and Google Drive enjoy the largest share of the market, with 78% of users surveyed claiming to use both.
      <br><br>Google Drive’s main draw is its seamless integration with Gmail, Google Docs and other Google products. The widespread adoption of Google products reinforces this tendency for users to throw all of their content into one cloud at the center of their digital lives, creating more opportunity for disorganization and blurring of work/home lines.
      <br><br>DropBox offers a similar service to Google Drive, and has strong features that integrate with both Google Docs and Microsoft Suite (something users expect to be standard). However, DropBox too is a generalist in the cloud storage space, overloaded with features and products, but ultimately proposing no central way of fundamentally organizing content aside from folders.
      <br><br>Box, the third largest player in the market, has the cleanest UI of all three, but basically offers an alternative to DropBox.
      <br><br>Other competitors in the market focus on helping users with digital organizational, such as Evernote, Notion, and WeTransfer. All offer niche tools yet fall short in the cloud storage arena. The features that delight users in this space are quick transfers of large files without having to create an account (WeTransfer), and the ability to write reminders (Notion, Evernote), store links from the web for quick access (Evernote, Notion), and to collaborate across teams (Notion, Evernote, Monday.com).<br><br><span class="bold-p">My competitive analysis confirmed that the market lacks a light-weight cloud storage platform that makes organizing all content easy, seperating work and home, while delivering basic organizational tools to assist the workflow of a modern professional.</span>

        <p>Building upon the data I collected from my user survey I wrote core user stories. The highest priority stories emerged as the key features I would be looking to build.
        <br><br>This exercise was helpful in identifying the four key features that I needed to build around, and identifying two organizational tools that would add value to the user experience. It also identified other features and actions that I would need to consider when designing.

        <p>Creating some core user flows based on the key features of my cloud storage service was the beginning of starting to think about the user experience and how these features would take form. In keeping with the idea that this platform should be easy to use and well organized, these user flows were refined down until they reached their simplest forms. The following are some key user flows that came out of this process.</p>

<!-- Prototyping Conclusions -->

      <h2 class="bloon-dark-h2">Early Prototyping Conclusions</h2>
        <p class="p-bloon-dark">The biggest takeaways from testing early prototypes was that users needed to easily see which files they’d already shared with other users. Some form of indication is necessary when viewing content, so users know what is still private, and what has been shared.
        <br><br>I also learned that users depend heavily on the ability to “drag and drop” content into their homepage. While the create/add button is important, a cloud product needs to contain drag and drop functionality.</p>

        <p>I created a hi-fidelity prototype to test on users. Since the ability to switch accounts is so important to this product, testing focused heavily on the ability to move between Home and Work accounts inside the application when prompted.<br><br>
        After this round of testing, it was clear there needed to be an easier way to “ground” users in which account they were currently in.<br><br>
        Adjustments were made along the way to the final design that helped establish location within the application. Furthermore, pop-up screens were moved up to accommodate smaller viewports.<br><br>

      <h2 class="bloon-h2">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This project forced me to rethink the mainstream cloud services we use to store and share content, and the ways in which we can simplify these products to better organize digital lives.<br><br>
        As a mainstream tool used by a diverse user base, it was hard to identify a niche market within the cloud storage market to serve. There are many “subgroups” of users in this space, but finding one to design for took research and iterating on the problems coming up while surveying.<br><br>
        It was vital to continue digging throughout the research and discovery phases of this project to understand what is frustrating cloud users.<br><br>
        The primary solution that Bloon proposes—the strict division of Work and Home content—surprised me in its simplistic nature, and how it hasn’t already been adopted by DropBox, Box, and Google Drive. I did not initially realize that this would be the core scope of the product. I believe this solution that is proposed with Bloon offers a simple answer to a real problem currently facing many cloud storage users.<br><br>
        In retrospect, it would have been helpful to spend even more time surveying and conducting conversations with a wide array of users. Time constraints limited the amount of research I was able to perform, but a wider net of opinions, ideas, and experiences would have greatly benefited the scope of this project.<br><br>
        I learned the value that constraints add to the design process, and the problems that can arise in an open-ended project.</p>
