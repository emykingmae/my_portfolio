    <h2 class="bloon-h2">Overview and project conception</h2>
    <p class="p-bloon">During the Covid-19 crisis, I noticed a significant swell of people taking up running as a form of reliable exercise. When in quarantine, running represents an easy way way to keep healthy, get some time outside, and burn off frustrations. As a result of the crisis, I also took up running as a hobby and primary form of exercise.
      <br><br>
      As a personal project, this led me to investigate the current marketplace of mobile running apps, and investigate the common experience of using the free versions of these apps to track runs. When researching, I was particularly interested in apps that catered specifically to runners (not just “fitness” apps). I was curious in first exploring the following questions:</p>
    <ol class="run-list">
      <br>
      <li>1) Aside from wearables, how are people tracking their miles (and what other health stats matter to them, if any)</li>
      <br>
      <li>2) Which apps are most popular for tracking running miles</li>
    </ol>

<!-- The Problem -->
  <section class="problem-section">
    <div class="problem-inner">
      <h2 class="bloon-dark-h2">Defining the Problem</h2>
        <p class="p-bloon-dark">While there are many running apps, the market lacks an app that doesn’t require an account to use for run-off runs. Additionally, my research revealed a lack of free, lightweight running tools that only track the very basic stats (miles, time, pace) without extra hassles. By offering a ton of features, many running apps provide a cluttered user experience (and many pester users to buy their company products or sign up for premium subscriptions).</p>

<!-- The Solution -->
  <section class="solution-section">
    <div class="solution-head">
      <h2 class="bloon-h2">Identifying a Redesigned Solution</h2>
        <p>
          To improve the free version of a running app and improve the user experience, a running app should strip away superfluous features for the free version, improve the UI by making it workout friendly, and offer users the ability to run with the app without registering an account (but only allow them to save runs once they’ve created an account).
          <br><br><span class="bold-p">
            By not requiring new users to create an account, we improve the user experience, and incentivize more runners to experience why our app is the best running app on the market. This, in turn, will lead to more user signups once users are able to experience the benefits of the app (and want to track their runs over time, which would require an account).</span>
        </p>
    </div>
    <figure class="solution-image">
      <img class="solution-img" src="media/images/solution-run.jpg" alt="Images from the App">
      <figcaption class="figcaptionblack">My redesigned running app takes all of the common features runners expect from the free versions of major apps, strips away unnecessary features, and proposes allowing new users run with the app without signing up.</figcaption>

  </section>

<!-- User Research -->
  <section class="UR-section">
    <div class="UR-head">
      <h2 class="bloon-h2">User and Market Research</h2>
        <p>I kicked off the project by journaling a bit about my own assumptions surrounding running apps, and doing a precursory dive into the market and major features that first come to mind when considering a mobile tool for running.
          <figure class="UF-images">
            <img class="run1-image" src="media/images/initial-thoughts-run.jpeg" alt="Writing my Initial Thoughts">
          </figure>

          <p>I expanded on this exercise by taking a closer examination of the major apps on the market, which I identified as Strava, MapMyRun (Under Armour), Runkeeper (Asics), Nike Run Club, Garmin Connect, and Apple Health. I read through reviews of these apps on the iOS app store, explored online running communities and blogs, and talked to as many people in my life as I could about their running practice. The aim was to gain a better understanding of the running world (outside of my own experience) and pick up on pain points associated with fitness tracking and using these mobile tools.</p>
          <br><br>
          <p>Part of this research included downloading four of the most popular apps on the market and testing them out myself over the course of a week. I completed four runs using each app’s free version, and further journaled my own observations and pain points. This exercise (literally!) was also helpful for starting to identify typical design themes, standard features, and copywriting tone. The apps I tested were: Strava, MapMyRun, Runkeeper, and Nike Run Club.</p>
          <br><br>
          <p>As a way to research actual users, I reached out to five colleagues and friends who I know run and had some open-ended conversations. I wanted to start by asking some basic questions about how they were currently tracking their miles, what they mostly sought to gain from any apps they use, which apps they’re using, and to tell me about their biggest frustrations or needs that aren’t currently being met.</p>
          <br><br>
          <p>Here are some of the big insights I gained from this group:</p>

            <ol class="running-list">
              <li>There’s no app that allows a one-time use / doesn’t require an account/sign-up (even if free)</li>
              <li>These apps tend to have confusing and cluttered in-workout UIs that are hard to read while running</li>
              <li>The Nike, Asics, and Under Armour apps push their merchandise on users within the UX, which is annoying</li>
            </ol>

            <figure class="UF-images">
              <img class="run2-image" src="media/images/running-research-text.jpeg" alt="User Research Text Message">
                <figcaption class="figcaptionblack">A common theme in my user outreach: wanting less features, and more simplicity.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>By this point it was clear that the application I was designing should not be looking to reinvent the wheel, but more so refine (and simplify) the current status quo of running applications. <span class="bold-p">The central question became How can a business improve the free version of their running app to better server runners (and therefore, grow their market share and subscription base, by offering the best free version on the market)?</span>
            <br><br>
            I refocused my thoughts on exactly what features the market was currently offering as standard in free versions, and cross-compared those features with what I had learned most users care about and actually need.</p>

            <figure class="UF-images">
              <img class="run1-image" src="media/images/priority-features-running.jpeg" alt="Journaling Key Features">
                <figcaption class="figcaptionblack">Refining a list of features that my redesign would need to have (and eliminating the bloat).</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br><br>
            <p>I then took some time to organize all of my data using the Lean Canvas framework and outline what the business incentive would be for undertaking this project. <span class="bold-p">What I identified from going through this exercise is that this redesign would be beneficial for an already established running app, to increase its position in the marketplace by improving the “free” version of its app.</span></p>

            </figure>

            <br><br>
            <p>And finally, before I began sketching, I wanted to write some helpful user stories that would keep me focused on the primary and core motives of users when opening a running app.</p>

        <p>I created a few simple flows using some simple Wireframes to begin laying out how users would navigate through the app. It was especially important for me to understand how we would onboard users, considering I was considering allowing a “no sign-up” option.</p>

      <h2 class="bloon-dark-h2">Mid-Project Discovery</h2>
        <p class="p-bloon-dark">Throughout the project I kept a small group of core users from my research phase that I kept reaching out to with further questions and updates. One big realization that came to light at this point in the project was that users who run with an Apple Watch (or other wearable) would expect the ability to sync their runs into this app.
          <br><br>While the advance metrics and health monitoring stats that come from wearables might not be something we’d offer in a free version of this app, they would be important to consider when further designing out additional features for the premium subscribers (down the road).
          <br><br>
          <span class="p-bloon-dark-bold">At the very least, it would be critical for me to design this “sync” moment for users looking to connect their wearables to the app.</span></p>

      <h2 class="bloon-h2">Conclusion and What I Learned</h2>
        <p>This was a quick project that I had limited resources with. If I had more time and a budget, I would want to conduct some rounds of user testing with a prototype of my high-fidelity screens. It would be ideal to work with a developer to build a basic version of this app in order to allow testing on a run.
          <br><br>
          I really struggled with balancing how to keep a running app profitable, and designing an app that doesn’t require sign-ups from every user. I do think it would be possible to allow users to use the app without creating an account, but I would want to test this theory on real users.
