    <h2 class="bloon-h2">Summary</h2>
      <p>This project was narrow in scope with one clear objective: designing a mobile screen for the app BusyBus, for bus riders to help better plan their journeys on public busses.
        <br><br>
      My research focused on discovering which tools bus riders are currently relying on, what their biggest frustrations are with those tools, and identifying the information they find most important when relying on public busses.</p>

    <div class="bb-problem-inner">
      <h2 class="bloon-dark-h2">The Problem</h2>
        <p class="p-bloon-dark">There were two core problems that I sought to solve in this project. Users needing to know:</p>
          <ol class="bb-list">
            <br>
              <li class="bb-prob-list">

          </ol>
          <br>

      <h2 class="bloon-h2">The Solution</h2>
        <p>The final design solution took the form of a simple list screen that delivered the primary needs of the average bus rider. The screen prioritizes the order of the next arriving busses to any given bus stop that a user searches, and displays exactly when they will come.</p>

<!-- User Research -->
  <section class="UR-section">
    <div class="UR-head">
      <h2 class="bb-h2">User Research</h2>
        <p>The discovery and research phase of this project kicked off with a deep user survey of a wide range of participants from across the United States in 22 cities. The two primary questions I sought answers to through this survey were discovering what apps/websites users were currently relying on to find bus times and schedules (if any), and what the most important features of these applications are to users.
          <br><br>
          What my survey revealed is that there are three key features that users need:</p>
        </p>
        <ol class="bb-ur-list">
          <br>
          <li>The ability to view all bus options/other busses that come through their bus stop</li>
          <br>
          <li>The ability to view current bus location (including bus stops/complete routes)</li>
          <br>
          <li>Seeing trip details (such as directions, possible connections, ETA/total trip time)</li>

<!-- Competitive Analysis -->
  <section class="CA-section">
    <div class="CA-head">
      <h2 class="bloon-h2">Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>
        GoogleMaps dominates this market because of its unmatched amount of local businesses/landmarks, and a superior UI for following directions,  trip details, and integration with users’ Google account. My competitive analysis confirmed that the biggest competitiors to GoogleMaps are apps that cater to local transportation systems, such as MTA’s BusTime app, in New York City.
        <br><br>
        What I found by comparing these two apps was that the only weakness GoogleMaps has is that it doesn’t do a great job of showing users<span class="bold-p"> every </span>bus that is currently on its way to a specific spot, (it only shows the next arriving bus); and it also doesn’t easily display users with a look at the entire route that a bus will make (instead, it focuses on a specific portion that a user has searched for).

<!-- User Stories -->
  <section class="User-Stories">
    <div class="US-head">
      <h2 class="bloon-h2">User Stories</h2>
        <p>I wrote User Stores to reflect the top things users are looking to see and do when opening a recipe app. This was a helpful exercise in rounding out the research phase of the project and documenting the features that would take front and center in my visual design work to come.
          <br><br>
          As previously noted, by now I’ve learned that the most important pieces of a recipe that users need are Directions and Ingredients, and then Timing:

          <p>This screen represented the focal point of my design challenge. My first iteration was a simple list, but lacked important clarifying details for users.
            <br><br>
            Through testing I learned how important it was to users to have more identifying information about each bus (direction) and the frequency of busses to follow.
            <br><br>
            Testing also revealed that users needed to know about busses that had been cancelled or were currently on service changes. These busses needed to be called out in some way. I iterated on this and added red to alert users of canceled busses, and grayed out busses which were not running currently.</p>

      <h2 class="bloon-h2">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I learned so much while working through this project, especially relating to solving for a specific problem and staying on task to address that problem and avoid scope creep.
          <br><br>
          I entered the project thinking a map feature to solve the user problem would be the best way to approach the problem. However, through testing screens on users (and returning again and again to the core problem at hand) it was clear a list view of the next arriving busses better served the user.
          <br><br>
          The map feature became a secondary tool that can be activated by switching between list view (primary) and map view (secondary) by clicking the icon in the top right of the screen.
          <br><br>
          If I had more resources to work and develop this application out further I would want to build on the research gathered in this project. Google Maps clearly has a stronghold of this market, but there is a huge demand for better tools in assisting public bus riders track their transportation options.
          <br><br>
          An app like BusyBus that can specifically serve bus riders and their nuanced questions is in high demand.
