    <h2 class="bloon-h2">Summary</h2>
      <p>This project was narrow in scope with one clear objective: designing a mobile screen for the app BusyBus, for bus riders to help better plan their journeys on public busses.
        <br><br>
      My research focused on discovering which tools bus riders are currently relying on, what their biggest frustrations are with those tools, and identifying the information they find most important when relying on public busses.</p>

<!-- The Problem -->
  <section class="problem-section">
    <div class="bb-problem-inner">
      <h2 class="bloon-dark-h2">The Problem</h2>
        <p class="p-bloon-dark">There were two core problems that I sought to solve in this project. Users needing to know:</p>
          <ol class="bb-list">
            <br>
              <li class="bb-prob-list">
                <div id="circle-1">
                  <span class="innerTEXT">1</span>
                </div>
                <span class="bold-p-dark">What is the next arriving bus</span>
              </li>
            <br>
            <li class="bb-prob-list">
              <div id="circle-2">
                <span class="innerTEXT2">2</span>
              </div>
              <span class="bold-p-dark">When is the bus coming</span>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br>
        <p class="p-bloon-dark">This problem set was was given to me in the client brief, and validated by my user research and exploration of the current marketplace for public transportation apps.</p>

<!-- The Solution -->
  <section class="solution-section">
    <div class="solution-head">
      <h2 class="bloon-h2">The Solution</h2>
        <p>The final design solution took the form of a simple list screen that delivered the primary needs of the average bus rider. The screen prioritizes the order of the next arriving busses to any given bus stop that a user searches, and displays exactly when they will come.</p>

<!-- User Research -->
  <section class="UR-section">
    <div class="UR-head">
      <h2 class="bb-h2">User Research</h2>
        <p>The discovery and research phase of this project kicked off with a deep user survey of a wide range of participants from across the United States in 22 cities. The two primary questions I sought answers to through this survey were discovering what apps/websites users were currently relying on to find bus times and schedules (if any), and what the most important features of these applications are to users.
          <br><br>
          What my survey revealed is that there are three key features that users need:</p>
        </p>
        <ol class="bb-ur-list">
          <br>
          <li>The ability to view all bus options/other busses that come through their bus stop</li>
          <br>
          <li>The ability to view current bus location (including bus stops/complete routes)</li>
          <br>
          <li>Seeing trip details (such as directions, possible connections, ETA/total trip time)</li>

<!-- Competitive Analysis -->
  <section class="CA-section">
    <div class="CA-head">
      <h2 class="bloon-h2">Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <span class="bold-p">I performed a Competitive Analysis of the three business models that currently serve users in this recipe space: Food Network Kitchen (mobile app), Pinterest (established online inspiration/ideas platform), Cooking Blogs (the largest source of user recipes).</p>
        <br>
        <p>There is a lot of upside for new competitors looking to break into this market due to a lack of established products, and a high demand for better recipe tools.
        <br><br>
        As my research showed, there is a diverse amount of users in this market--anyone who cooks at home and/or anyone who wants to learn how to cook more efficiently. While there are a handful apps in the market, none clearly address the key problems I uncovered in my discovery phase.
        <br><br>
        My user research revealed that most users are finding their recipes browsing the web and landing on cooking blogs. The majority of users are then following these recipes by viewing them on their devices in the kitchen.
        <br><br>
        In addition, many users are finding recipes via Instagram and Pinterest. A photo of a meal leads to a post, which leads to yet another cooking blog.</b>
        <br><br><span class="bold-p">
        What my analysis of the market confirmed was that opportunity exists for a digital product that can help users find recipes from across the web in one singular place, where they can also save/archive these recipes, and easily follow the recipes on their device.

<!-- User Stories -->
  <section class="User-Stories">
    <div class="US-head">
      <h2 class="bloon-h2">User Stories</h2>
        <p>I wrote User Stores to reflect the top things users are looking to see and do when opening a recipe app. This was a helpful exercise in rounding out the research phase of the project and documenting the features that would take front and center in my visual design work to come.
          <br><br>
          As previously noted, by now I’ve learned that the most important pieces of a recipe that users need are Directions, Ingredients, and Timing:

<!-- User Flows-->
  <section class="User-Flows">
    <div class="UF-head">
      <h2 class="bloon-h2">Creating a M.V.P. Site Map</h2>
        <p>The visual design process started with sketching out some basic User Flows that would facilitate top user stories within the app (mainly: 1. finding a recipe 2. following a recipe 3. saving a recipe). I‘m not including these here for the sake of brevity, but you can view some of my user flows <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CeI2qaBEKllcuzJNgyJ7snMdb1a3A4cK?usp=sharing" target="_blank" ><i class="google-link">at this GoogleDrive location.</i></a>
        <br><br>
        I used this site map to help guide my user flow creation, and later on, keep track of the main sections within the app.

<!-- Sketches -->
  <section class="Sketching-section">
    <div class="sketching-head">
      <h2 class="bloon-h3">Sketching</h2>
        <p>When I started thinking about visual design for the app, I began by sketching out the three main screens core to the experience: a Home screen, a "Saved Recipes" screen, and a "New Recipes" screen (where users could search and browse for new recipes).<br>
        </p>
    </div>

    <figure class="sketching-images">
      <img class="sketching-image1" src="media/images/mise-sketch1.jpg" alt="Sketching Examples">
        <figcaption class="figcaptionblack2">I sketched many iterations, but these screens were the first I wanted to pursue further. I was initially considering the idea of a “Tinder for Recipes” swipe feature to greet users on the Home Screen (this idea was later dropped in testing; besides a fun interaction, it didn’t do much to solve a user problem).</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <figure class="sketching-images">
      <img class="sketching-image2" src="media/images/mise-sketch2.jpg" alt="Sketching Examples">
        <figcaption class="figcaptionblack2">I began to sketch further the main Recipe screen. At first, I was working with a way to include the Directions and Ingredients on the same page, with sample recipe photos.</figcaption>

<!-- Wireframes -->
  <section class="Mise-Wireframes-section">
    <div class="Wireframe-head">
      <h2 class="bloon-h3">Wireframes</h2>
        <p>An exciting (and also daunting) challenge for a recipe application to address is the amount of information that needs to be included on screens, and in a clear and easy to red way. If users were not able to quickly glance at the interface and receive exactly the small piece of information they were looking for (an ingredient, or a temperature) then the app would not be solving my core problems.
          <br><br>
            Wireframing out the recipe screens for the first time unearthed how nuanced this challenge would be.
          <br><br>
            My early goal of including Directions and Ingredients simultaneously on the recipe page faced an issue with early testing, as Direction text was not able to fit in an easily readable way.
          <br><br>
            Questions also started to arise of how much imagery to include in the screens, and how this would help (or hinder) the user flow. </p>

<!-- Prototyping Conclusions -->

    <div class="PC-head">
      <h2 class="bloon-dark-h2">Takeaways from Sketching and Wireframing</h2>
        <p class="p-bloon-dark">Working through my sketches, and beginning to test with Wireframes, the questions that arose the most were that of layout/spacing and information architecture. Within this app there are moments where a lot of text and information needs to be displayed on screen (especially within the recipes). I was often facing questions of how best to organize the information architecture, and ultimately, realized I would need to employ swiping screens and drop-downs to maximize space.<br><br>At this point I was ready to continue with building a clean UI that solves the central problem of displaying core recipe details (Directions + Ingredients). But first I needed to establish a brand direction and style guide. </p>

<!-- Branding -->
  <section class="Branding-Section">
    <div class="Branding-head">
      <h2 class="bloon-h2">Branding</h2>
        <p>Creating a brand for this app was a lot of fun.
          <br><br>
          The name of the app, Mise en Place, roots itself in the classic traditions of French chefs (having all of your ingredients and directions ready before you begin). As for color, I started out brainstorming in a limited, monochromatic color palette, with very neutral colors and not a lot of variety. I realized quickly that this was an app that promotes creativity, inspiration, and needed lots of bold color choices. Cooking is a creative and personal exercise, and I felt the UI for this app should inspire creativity and an approachable attitude to cooking (and also, allow users to have a bit of fun at the same time and not take the task at hand too seriously).
        <br><br>
        This is an application that has a large base of core users, so I was challenged with developing a brand that suited everyone. The solution I landed on is a modern look that appeals to young users, and older users alike. It will inspire users of all ages to have fun in the kitchen, and to not be intimidated by ingredients and directions.</p>

        <p>Creating a style guide for the Bloon brand revolved around coming back to the two principles of <span class="bold-p">simplicity</span> and <span class="bold-p">minimalism</span>. From the san-serif typography, to the color accessibility grades, everything needed to be simple, clean and widely accessible.
        <br><br>The branding also features custom illustration work that I created.</p>

        <p>Iterating through the visual design process saw me testing four rounds of Hi-Fi screens on users with an InVision prototype, and then in the final round of testing, a Figma Prototype (I prefer to prototype in Figma, due to the extra control it allows with micro-animations and usability for testing participants). These rounds of testing took place remote over Zoom in the middle of the Covid-19 crisis.</p>

The Recipe Title was moved into the top Nav, to save space and also display more prominently.

      <h2 class="bloon-h2">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>If I had more time and resources I would want to continue testing and iterating over this minimum viable product (MVP). Specifically, I would like to build a social aspect to the app that helps users see what their friends and family are cooking, and be able to interact accordingly and share recipes within the app.
          <br><br>
          Being in a situation where I was forced to conduct all my testing remotely taught me a lot about the possibilities (and drawbacks) of testing remotely. On the upside, you can reach more participants faster and conduct more tests when you are doing all remote tests. In these situations, the script you develop to walk participants through your prototype becomes even more important. In order for you to take real data away from the testing experience, you need to help them feel comfortable with your prototype from afar.
          <br><br>
          Taking the time to learn and adjust to the best technologies to assist with remote testing is well worth the UX payoff.
