      <p>‘Mise en Place’ is an mobile app born of the idea that following a recipe in the kitchen has become harder than it needs to be in the era of inconsistent cooking blogs. The purpose of this project was to explore ways to improve the user experience of following a recipe online while working in the kitchen.</p>

<!-- The Problem -->
  <section class="problem-section">
    <div class="problem-inner">
      <h2 class="bloon-dark-h2">The Problem</h2>
        <p class="p-bloon-dark">An extensive user survey concluded that a majority of people are relying on recipes that they find online, specifically from cooking blogs. There are two main problems that currently arise from this:</p>
        <ol class="mise-list">
          <br>
          <li>1) Cooking blogs often bury the most important recipe information (Directions & Ingredients) behind Ads, recipe backstory, and author self-promotion. I learned that users are not interested in any of these things.</li>
          <br>
          <li>2) Following these recipes in the kitchen is often cumbersome. Most users opt to email the link to themselves for later viewing, and then are forced to scroll up and down to view different parts of the recipe as they follow along with dirty fingers. Finding recipes from all over the web creates a secondary problem: it’s hard to archive and save these recipes in a central location (aside from creating browser bookmarks).</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

<!-- The Solution -->
  <section class="solution-section">
    <div class="solution-head">
      <h2 class="bloon-h2">The Solution</h2>
        <p>
          What my research revealed was that these two user user problems are deeply connected to the nature of online cooking blogs/communities. Inherent to these platforms is that they stand alone as webpages, with no way to link them for users; additionally, the business strategy for these cooking blogs requires the inclusion of paid advertisements and the fostering of author personality and story (two things that users don’t need when following a recipe).
          <br><br><span class="bold-p">
          Mise en Place solves these issues by offering a publishing platform for recipe bloggers to publish on in an optimized way that allows users to find new recipes, curate a recipe box, and easy follow recipes in the kitchen.</span>
          <br><br>
          Mise en Place prioritizes the two most important features of a recipe for users (Directions and Ingredients). The recipe experience is designed to be hands-off for users while in the kitchen, designed with minimal scrolling and screen touching in mind.
        </p>

<!-- User Research -->
  <section class="UR-section">
    <div class="UR-head">
      <h2 class="bloon-h2">User Research</h2>
        <p>I conducted a wide-ranging survey from people across the U.S. between the ages of 18 and 50 years-old. 74% of the participants surveyed said they get their recipes mostly online/from cooking blogs. Within that group of people, 96% of participants said they then follow along to the recipes they find on their phone or other device whilst in the kitchen.
          <br><br>
          I also learned from my survey that what frustrates users the most about using their devices in the kitchen is the lock screen on their phones and keeping their devices clean, not being able to see all the ingredients/directions at the same time, and being unable to keep track of recipes they've tried in the past.<br><br>
        <span class="bold-p">Most important features of a recipe, according to users surveyed:</p>
        </p>
        <canvas id="myChart3"></canvas>
        <p>Other takeaways from my user survey are that users aren’t interested in the backstory/history of recipes, and for those users who don’t currently cook a lot, 57% say that improved technology in the kitchen might persuade them to cook more.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

<!-- User Personas -->
  <section class="User-Personas">
    <div class="UP-head">
      <h2 class="bloon-h2">User Personas</h2>
      <p>I wrote some personas to help breathe life into some of the main voices that kept coming out of the data collected in my user survey. Through refining my data into real personalities I was able to stay focused on my core users during the upcoming visual design process.
        <br><br>
        Though the user base for a recipe app is large, there are specific themes that repeat throughout the survey feedback, including a desire to cook more in order to live a healthy and more budget-friendly life, feeling overwhelmed by cooking and wanting to learn how to cook better/more efficiently, and feeling like an improved way of viewing and collecting recipes would encourage/aid with more cooking throughout the week.

<!-- Competitive Analysis -->
  <section class="CA-section">
    <div class="CA-head">
      <h2 class="bloon-h2">Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <span class="bold-p">I performed a Competitive Analysis of the three business models that currently serve users in this recipe space: Food Network Kitchen (mobile app), Pinterest (established online inspiration/ideas platform), Cooking Blogs (the largest source of user recipes).</p>
        <br>
        <p>There is a lot of upside for new competitors looking to break into this market due to a lack of established products, and a high demand for better recipe tools.
        <br><br>
        As my research showed, there is a diverse amount of users in this market--anyone who cooks at home and/or anyone who wants to learn how to cook more efficiently. While there are a handful apps in the market, none clearly address the key problems I uncovered in my discovery phase.
        <br><br>
        My user research revealed that most users are finding their recipes browsing the web and landing on cooking blogs. The majority of users are then following these recipes by viewing them on their devices in the kitchen.
        <br><br>
        In addition, many users are finding recipes via Instagram and Pinterest. A photo of a meal leads to a post, which leads to yet another cooking blog.</b>
        <br><br><span class="bold-p">
        What my analysis of the market confirmed was that opportunity exists for a digital product that can help users find recipes from across the web in one singular place, where they can also save/archive these recipes, and easily follow the recipes on their device.

<!-- User Stories -->
  <section class="User-Stories">
    <div class="US-head">
      <h2 class="bloon-h2">User Stories</h2>
        <p>I wrote User Stores to reflect the top things users are looking to see and do when opening a recipe app. This was a helpful exercise in rounding out the research phase of the project and documenting the features that would take front and center in my visual design work to come.
          <br><br>
          As previously noted, by now I’ve learned that the most important pieces of a recipe that users need are Directions, Ingredients, and Timing:

<!-- User Flows-->
  <section class="User-Flows">
    <div class="UF-head">
      <h2 class="bloon-h2">Creating a M.V.P. Site Map</h2>
        <p>The visual design process started with sketching out some basic User Flows that would facilitate top user stories within the app (mainly: 1. finding a recipe 2. following a recipe 3. saving a recipe). I‘m not including these here for the sake of brevity, but you can view some of my user flows <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CeI2qaBEKllcuzJNgyJ7snMdb1a3A4cK?usp=sharing" target="_blank" ><i class="google-link">at this GoogleDrive location.</i></a>
        <br><br>
        I used this site map to help guide my user flow creation, and later on, keep track of the main sections within the app.

  <section class="Sketching-section">
    <div class="sketching-head">
      <h2 class="bloon-h3">Sketching</h2>
        <p>When I started thinking about visual design for the app, I began by sketching out the three main screens core to the experience: a Home screen, a "Saved Recipes" screen, and a "New Recipes" screen (where users could search and browse for new recipes).<br>
        </p>
    </div>

        <figcaption class="figcaptionblack2">I sketched many iterations, but these screens were the first I wanted to pursue further. I was initially considering the idea of a “Tinder for Recipes” swipe feature to greet users on the Home Screen (this idea was later dropped in testing; besides a fun interaction, it didn’t do much to solve a user problem).</figcaption>

<!-- Wireframes -->
  <section class="Mise-Wireframes-section">
    <div class="Wireframe-head">
      <h2 class="bloon-h3">Wireframes</h2>
        <p>An exciting (and also daunting) challenge for a recipe application to address is the amount of information that needs to be included on screens, and in a clear and easy to red way. If users were not able to quickly glance at the interface and receive exactly the small piece of information they were looking for (an ingredient, or a temperature) then the app would not be solving my core problems.
          <br><br>
            Wireframing out the recipe screens for the first time unearthed how nuanced this challenge would be.
          <br><br>
            My early goal of including Directions and Ingredients simultaneously on the recipe page faced an issue with early testing, as Direction text was not able to fit in an easily readable way.
          <br><br>
            Questions also started to arise of how much imagery to include in the screens, and how this would help (or hinder) the user flow. </p>

<!-- Prototyping Conclusions -->

    <div class="PC-head">
      <h2 class="bloon-dark-h2">Takeaways from Sketching and Wireframing</h2>
        <p class="p-bloon-dark">Working through my sketches, and beginning to test with Wireframes, the questions that arose the most were that of layout/spacing and information architecture. Within this app there are moments where a lot of text and information needs to be displayed on screen (especially within the recipes). I was often facing questions of how best to organize the information architecture, and ultimately, realized I would need to employ swiping screens and drop-downs to maximize space.<br><br>At this point I was ready to continue with building a clean UI that solves the central problem of displaying core recipe details (Directions + Ingredients). But first I needed to establish a brand direction and style guide. </p>
    </div>

<!-- Branding -->
  <section class="Branding-Section">
    <div class="Branding-head">
      <h2 class="bloon-h2">Branding</h2>
        <p>Creating a brand for this app was a lot of fun.
          <br><br>
          The name of the app, Mise en Place, roots itself in the classic traditions of French chefs (having all of your ingredients and directions ready before you begin). As for color, I started out brainstorming in a limited, monochromatic color palette, with very neutral colors and not a lot of variety. I realized quickly that this was an app that promotes creativity, inspiration, and needed lots of bold color choices. Cooking is a creative and personal exercise, and I felt the UI for this app should inspire creativity and an approachable attitude to cooking (and also, allow users to have a bit of fun at the same time and not take the task at hand too seriously).
        <br><br>
        This is an application that has a large base of core users, so I was challenged with developing a brand that suited everyone. The solution I landed on is a modern look that appeals to young users, and older users alike. It will inspire users of all ages to have fun in the kitchen, and to not be intimidated by ingredients and directions.</p>

        <p>Creating a style guide for the Bloon brand revolved around coming back to the two principles of <span class="bold-p">simplicity</span> and <span class="bold-p">minimalism</span>. From the san-serif typography, to the color accessibility grades, everything needed to be simple, clean and widely accessible.

        <p>Iterating through the visual design process saw me testing four rounds of Hi-Fi screens on users with an InVision prototype, and then in the final round of testing, a Figma Prototype (I prefer to prototype in Figma, due to the extra control it allows with micro-animations and usability for testing participants). These rounds of testing took place remote over Zoom in the middle of the Covid-19 crisis.</p>

The Recipe Title was moved into the top Nav, to save space and also display more prominently.

      <h2 class="bloon-h2">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>If I had more time and resources I would want to continue testing and iterating over this minimum viable product (MVP). Specifically, I would like to build a social aspect to the app that helps users see what their friends and family are cooking, and be able to interact accordingly and share recipes within the app.
          <br><br>
          Being in a situation where I was forced to conduct all my testing remotely taught me a lot about the possibilities (and drawbacks) of testing remotely. On the upside, you can reach more participants faster and conduct more tests when you are doing all remote tests. In these situations, the script you develop to walk participants through your prototype becomes even more important. In order for you to take real data away from the testing experience, you need to help them feel comfortable with your prototype from afar.
          <br><br>
          Taking the time to learn and adjust to the best technologies to assist with remote testing is well worth the UX payoff.
